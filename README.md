# Hands-on Machine Learning 

This is the collection of complimentary codes and scripts that accompany the machine learning textbook by Aurelien Geron [link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) . These resources have been thoughtfully prepared to complement the theoretical concepts discussed in the book and provide practical implementations.

The codes provided in this collection closely align with the examples and exercises presented in the textbook. While most of the code snippets are derived from the book, some have been modified to offer alternative approaches, enhance clarity, or showcase advanced variations of the algorithms.

These codes aim to serve as humble companions to the textbook, offering readers an opportunity to deepen their understanding through practical application. Even though each code snippet is accompanied by comments and explanations, providing step-by-step guidance for readers to follow along, the reader still needs to activately think through the concepts in order to learn.

## Getting Started

Before embarking on your journey into the fascinating field of machine learning, it is important to have a solid foundation in the necessary prerequisites. To make the most of your studies, it is recommended to have a good understanding of programming concepts, with a particular focus on the Python programming language. This will provide you with a solid framework for working with popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Scikit-learn is a powerful and widely-used machine learning library in Python that offers a comprehensive range of algorithms and tools for various tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of datasets, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

TensorFlow, on the other hand, is a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is designed to facilitate the creation of complex deep learning models and enables efficient computation on both CPUs and GPUs. TensorFlow's versatility and scalability have made it a go-to choice for many researchers and professionals working in the field of machine learning.

Having a solid grasp of these libraries will enable you to leverage their capabilities and apply various machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Additionally, having a strong foundation in fundamental mathematical concepts, such as linear algebra and calculus, will allow you to understand the underlying principles and algorithms used in these libraries.

A basic understanding of statistics and probability theory is also valuable, as these concepts are fundamental to evaluating and interpreting the results of machine learning models. Finally, proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using libraries like pandas, as well as data visualization using tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, will allow you to effectively preprocess and explore datasets.

### Prerequisites
To study machine learning using scikit-learn and TensorFlow, you will need the following software packages:

1. Python: The programming language used for machine learning.
2. NumPy: A library for numerical computing and arrays.
3. scikit-learn: A machine learning library for various tasks.
4. TensorFlow: An open-source framework for deep learning.
5. Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
6. Matplotlib: A plotting library for data visualization.
7. Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for coding and documentation.
8. Working PC (linux OS preferred) such as Ubuntu OS PC. For other platforms, please consult other sources.

### Installing
I recommend using the package manager called Anaconda to install all the required Python packages. Anaconda is a powerful package manager and distribution platform for Python and other programming languages. It simplifies the installation and management of software packages required for machine learning, such as NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. With Anaconda, you can create isolated environments to manage different project dependencies, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility. By using the Anaconda command-line interface or the Anaconda Navigator graphical interface, you can easily install, update, and manage all the required software packages, making it effortless to set up your machine learning environment and get started with your projects. Please do your own research about Anaconda to install all the required packages.
